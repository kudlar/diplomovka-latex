\begin{abstract}
Presented paper deals with the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Mediation Problem. 
The problem was elaborated by IPFIX working group in RFC~5982 and RFC~6183.
The aim of this work is to design and implement an IPFIX Mediation Framework of the 
SLAmeter monitoring tool based on these documents. 
The analytical part is devoted to the IPFIX protocol and the IPFIX Mediation 
Problem. Monitoring applications SLAmeter and BasicMeter are analysed as well. 
The core part of the paper 
is represented by the design and description of~implementation workflow of~IPFIX Mediation Framework. 
Accuracy of solutions is confirmed by experimental verification at the end of the paper. The main
contribution of this work is to extend the possibilities of monitoring application SLAmeter.

\section{Introduction}

The trend of recent years in computer networking are converged networks which combine data, 
voice and video transmission into one common infrastructure. However, with increasing growth 
of~opportunities raises demand for~quality. In~order~to compare or even increase quality 
of~networks and service, it is necessary to have the ability to measure network parameters.

SLAmeter is measuring architecture being developed by the MONICA research group in Computer 
Networks Laboratory at the Technical University of Ko\v{s}ice. It is a tool for passive 
flow-based measurement and subsequent network traffic analysis with the purpose of determing 
the grade of network quality \cite{slameter}.

Flow-based measurement is a popular method for various network
monitoring usages. The sharing of flow-based information for
monitoring applications having different requirements raises some
open issues in terms of measurement system scalability and capacity, flow-based
measurement flexibility, and export reliability. \emph{IP Flow
Information Export (IPFIX) Mediation} may help resolve these issues \cite{rfc5982}.

\section{Motivation}

To fulfill application requirements with limited system resources, the IPFIX architecture needs to 
introduce an intermediate entity between Exporters and Collectors. From a data manipulation point of 
view, this intermediate entity may provide the aggregation, correlation, filtering, and modification of 
Flow Records to save measurement system resources and to perform preprocessing tasks for the Collector. 
From a protocol conversion point of view, this intermediate entity may provide conversion into IPFIX, 
or conversion of IPFIX transport protocols (e.g., from unreliable, connectionless UDP to the 
Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)) to improve the export reliability \cite{rfc6183}. 


\section{Goals}

The aim of this work is to analyze, design, implement and test an framework for 
intermediate entity (Mediator) between exporter and collector in the IPFIX protocol.
It also integrates the solution with the existing architecture of the SLAmeter monitoring 
tool. Framework put a great emphasis on its modularity in order to make it easy and convenient 
to implement new mediation modules and thereby increase monitoring possibilities of SLAmeter.

\section{Analysis}

\subsection{Terminology and Definitions}

The IPFIX-specific terminology used in this paper is defined in \cite{rfc5101}.  Let us define 
the IPFIX Mediation-specific terms here.

\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Record stream} -- a stream of records carrying flow-based information. The records are
 encoded as IPFIX Data Records.
 
 \item \textbf{IPFIX Mediation} -- the manipulation and conversion of a record stream for subsequent 
 export using the IPFIX protocol.
 
 \item \textbf{Intermediate Process} -- takes a record stream as its input from Collecting Processes, 
 or other Intermediate Processes performs some transformations on this stream, based 
 upon the content of each record and passes the transformed record stream as its output to Exporting 
 Processes, or other Intermediate Processes, in order to perform IPFIX Mediation.
 
 \item \textbf{IPFIX Mediator} is an IPFIX Device that provides IPFIX Mediation by receiving a record 
 stream from IPFIX Exporter or other Mediator, hosting one or more Intermediate Processes to transform 
 that stream, and exporting the transformed record stream to IPFIX Collector via IPFIX Messages. \cite{rfc5982}
 \end{itemize}

 architecture examples.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Problem statement}

Network administrators generally face the problems of measurement system scalability, Flow-based 
measurement flexibility, and export reliability, even if some techniques, such as Packet Sampling,
Filtering, Data Records aggregation, and export replication, have already been developed.  

The problems consist of adjusting some parameters of metering devices to resources of the measurement 
system while fulfilling appropriate conditions: data accuracy, Flow granularity, and export reliability. 
These conditions depend on two factors -- \textbf{measurement system capacity} and 
\textbf{application requirements}.

Due to resource limitations of the measurement system, it is important to use traffic data reduction 
techniques as early as possible, e.g., at the Exporter.  However, this implementation is made difficult 
by the heterogeneous environment of exporting devices. On the other hand, keeping data accuracy and 
Flow granularity to meet the requirements of different monitoring applications requires a scalable and 
flexible collecting infrastructure.

This implies that a new Mediation function is required in typical Exporter-Collector architectures. \cite{rfc5982}

\subsection{Mediation Applicability Examples} \label{sec:application}

RFC 5982 \cite{rfc5982} provides several examples of IPFIX Mediator applications. Let us mention a few 
of then:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Data record anonymization, 
 \item Interoperability between legacy protocols and IPFIX,
 \item Adjusting flow granularity,
 \item Flow-Based sampling and selection,
 \item Distributed collecting infrastructure, 
 \item Time composition,
 \item Spatial composition.
%   \subitem Spatial composition within one Observation Domain,
%   \subitem Spatial composition across Observation Domains, but within a single Original Exporter,
%   \subitem Spatial composition across Exporters,
%   \subitem Spatial composition across administrative domains.
\end{itemize}

\section{Solution and Results}

\subsection{Application design}

IPFIX Mediation Problem Framework and its architecture is analysed in RFC 6183~\cite{rfc6183}. Based on 
the IPFIX Mediation reference model as an extension of the IPFIX reference model presented 
in \emph{Architecture for IP Flow Information Export} -- RFC~5470~\cite{rfc5470} was designed 
application \emph{Mediator v1.0} architecture. Fig.~\ref{o:eng_reference-model} covers the various 
possible 
scenarios that can exist in the \emph{Mediator v1.0} monitoring system. The functional components 
within each entity are indicated within brackets []. \emph{Mediator v1.0} receives IPFIX Flow Records 
from other IPFIX Mediators and Exporters via UDP transport protocol. Processed IPFIX Flow records are 
exported to Collector or other IPFIX Mediator via UDP.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{kudla/eng_reference-model}
\caption{Mediator v1.0 reference model overview}\label{o:eng_reference-model}
\end{figure}

Basic \emph{Mediator v1.0} component model is shown in the Fig.~\ref{o:eng_mediator-components}. The 
Mediator may contain one or more Intermediate Processes hierarchically located between one Collecting and one
Exporting Process. 

Intermediate Processes are key functional blocks for IPFIX Mediation. Data flow between them is managed 
in the following ways:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Parallel processing} - record stream is processed by Intermediate Processes simultaneously. 
 In this setup, each Intermediate Process receives a copy of the entire record stream as its input.
 \item \textbf{Serial processing} - In order to ensure flexible manipulation of a record stream, 
 the Intermediate Processes are connected serially. In that case, an output record stream from one 
 Intermediate Process forms an input for a succeeding Intermediate Process.
\end{itemize}

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{kudla/eng_mediator-components}
\caption{Basic Mediator v1.0 component model}\label{o:eng_mediator-components}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Implementation of Mediator v1.0}

\subsubsection{Main class}

The role of the main class is to process command line arguments and then start all threads needed to run
the application. These threads are following: UDP Server, UDP Processor, UDP Exporter and each Intermediate 
Process is single thread as well. In case of error is Mediator shut down correctly so it realeases memory and stops all 
running threads. Same situation occurs after pressing \verb|Ctrl-c|. 

\subsubsection{Collecting Process}

Logical structure of this process involves two stages, where each stage is one thread. 
Let us briefly describe the individual stages of the Collecting Process.

First stage is shown in Fig.~\ref{o:collecting1_schema}. A core class of this stage is \emph{UDPServer} 
which receives byte stream of IPFIX messages sent from Exporter via UDP protocol. This stream is wrapped 
into the \emph{PacketObject} and written to fast, blocking FIFO queue called \emph{PacketCache}. Application 
design allows for future extension with another transport protocols, such as TCP and SCTP. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{kudla/collecting1_schema}
\caption{First stage of Collecting Process of Mediator v1.0}\label{o:collecting1_schema}
\end{figure}

Scheme of second stage depicts Fig.~\ref{o:collecting2_schema}. The UDP Processor thread works in cycle --
it reads packet objects from cache and sends them to IPFIX Parser. IPFIX Packets are split up there into
IPFIX message header, IPFIX template sets, data sets and options template sets. These entities are 
processed and transformed to flow records. IPFIX Parser sents each flow record with additional information 
to class representing dispatcher of flow records.

\section{Conclusion}

% The goal of this work was to design mechanism established on algebraic relations in 
% evolution model. Based on semantic of pointcut designators (as they are defined in 
% AspectJ) to identify the pointcuts in evolution model.
% 
% The method provides some advantages. In the implementation phase it is clear, whether 
% the specified requirements can be reached. Secondary, some partial automation may be 
% brought into the software development process.
% 
% There are also some disadvantages consider. Some of the generated variants are not 
% the realization of the system. With growing number of functions and pointcuts, the 
% time needed for generating all variants grows. Therefore the application of this 
% method is effective for small systems only. This disadvantages might be improved by 
% the next research.
